README.txt
This is the README file for Zach Schlamowitz's Honors Thesis project on 
modeling oxidative stress response in single cells using an ODE model of 
the peroxiredoxin signaling / stress response system. The initial model is
based on Selvaggio (2018) "Mapping the phenotypic repertoire of the cytoplasmic 
2-Cys peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system"
